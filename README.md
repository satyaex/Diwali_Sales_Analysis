# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
# Overview
The Diwali Sales Analysis project is a Python-based data analysis project that aims to provide insights into sales patterns during the Diwali festival. The project involves several stages, including data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, to extract valuable information from the dataset.

# Project Details
1. Data Cleaning
Before conducting any analysis, the dataset undergoes a data cleaning process to ensure accurate and consistent results. This step involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies present in the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory data analysis phase involves in-depth analysis of various aspects of sales data during Diwali. The following insights have been derived from the analysis:

Sales by Gender: The analysis reveals that a majority of buyers are females. Furthermore, the purchasing power of females surpasses that of males.

Sales by Age: The age group of 26-35 exhibits the highest purchasing activity, indicating a target demographic for marketing efforts.

Sales by State: The states with the highest order volumes are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, respectively.

Sales by Marital Status: Married women stand out as a significant customer segment with substantial purchasing power.

Sales by Occupation: The top buying occupations include IT, Healthcare, and Aviation.

Sales by Product Category: The analysis also covers sales distribution across different product categories.

# Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, exhibit strong purchasing power, particularly in the Food, Clothing, and Electronic categories. These insights can guide marketing and sales strategies for future Diwali seasons.
